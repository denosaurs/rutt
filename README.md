# Rutt

Rutt is a tiny http router designed for use with deno and deno deploy. It is
written in about 200 lines of code and is pretty fast, using an extended type of
the web-standard
[`URLPattern`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) to
provide fast and easy route matching.

```ts
import { router } from "https://deno.land/x/rutt/mod.ts";

await Deno.serve(
  router({
    "/": (_req) => new Response("Hello world!", { status: 200 }),
  }),
).finished;
```
